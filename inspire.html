            <h2>Why Paul Mccartney is my Hero</h2>
            <p>I first learned of Paul McCartney in middle school in my History of Rock and Roll class. <br> 
                Ever since then I became very interested in their contribution to music and really enjoy the way he and the Beatles wrote songs.</p>
